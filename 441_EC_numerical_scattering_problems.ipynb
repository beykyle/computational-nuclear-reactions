        "The Yukawa potential we used above can be good for some cases, but the professionals in nucleon-nucleus reactions use something called optical model potentials. Optical model potentials are a class of models for the interaction between a nucleon and a nucleus. They are typically phenomenological (tuned to experiment), and attempt to describe the energy-averaged behavior (e.g. they treat resonances only on average). They are important tools for evaluating nuclear cross sections, especially in the fast neutron region, and for regions of the chart of isotopes that are difficult to access experimentally.\n",

        "\n",
        "For the interested, one of the most commonly used optical potentials was created in [2003 by Koning and Delaroche](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947402013210?casa_token=MyOMbEfEwkwAAAAA:jcD30qI-5JObIVcGCDXiFxbiStTFOTlDow3ncy7dG4qjYPqftLnhzglHA64DJO_GzMsInWxoLg).

It has long been known that the nuclear surface region is important in nuclear reactions. Many optical potentials therefore also include a surface peaked term parameterized as the derivative of a Woods-Saxon function. This is called the surface term, whereas the other term is called the volume term.\n",
        "\n",
        "The surface term is especially important at low energy, when an incident nucleon cannot penetrate deeply into nucleus, and instead interacts primarily with the valence nucleon's wavefunctions.

The system can never leave the elastic channel. By simply adding negative complex terms to the potential, we can model our projectile leaving the elastic channel to form a compound nucleus with the target, without making any major modifications to our formalism. Of course, this only treats inelastic processes in an average sense - to account for specific, discrete resonances we need to use a more complicated formalism we won't talk about here. If you're curious, physicists have derived what these imaginary terms should look like, using a formalism called [Feshbach-Fano partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feshbach%E2%80%93Fano_partitioning).\n",
